        <h2>Description of Book</h2>
        <mark> "Rich Dad Poor Dad"</mark> by <b>Robert T. Kiyosaki</b> is a personal finance classic that compares two contrasting mindsets around money: one from his 
        biological (poor) father and the other from his best friend’s (rich) father. The book offers practical advice and challenges traditional beliefs 
        about wealth, education, and financial independence.
