    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Drawing and Sketching Cartoons</h2>
    <p><b>Drawing</b> is something I’ve loved since childhood, especially sketching cartoon characters like
        <i>Doraemon</i> and <i>Mickey Mouse</i>. It helps me express creativity and relax after a long day. When I draw,
        I feel free to use my imagination and bring my favorite characters to life.</p>

    <p>I often use pencil and paper for sketches, and sometimes add color to bring out the fun. I’ve even recreated
        characters like <u>SpongeBob</u>, <u>Tom & Jerry</u>, and <u>Chhota Bheem</u>. Drawing cartoons is both relaxing
        and rewarding, and I like to share my art with friends and online communities.<br><br>

        I carry my sketchbook to draw during breaks or whenever I get a moment to relax.</p>

    <h2>Afternoon</h2>
    <p>Afternoons are spent attending practical labs or working on assignments. I grab lunch in the canteen with
        friends. After college, I take a short break, sometimes scroll through memes or sketch a cartoon.</p>

    <h2>Evening</h2>
    <p>Evenings are for self-study and project work. After dinner, I watch some shows, draw something new, or play a
        quick online chess game. I try to sleep by <i>11 PM</i> to stay fresh for the next day.</p>
